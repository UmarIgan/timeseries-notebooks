# timeseries-notebooks

There are many time series packages list [here](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/popular-timeseries-packages)

So here they are. 

If you are interested in contributing, issues are maintained in the timemachines package including suggestions for new notebooks here. See also the [contributors guide](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md).
