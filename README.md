# timeseries-notebooks

There are many time series packages list [here](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/popular-timeseries-packages) 

Surprisingly few contain the most basic "hello world" univariate example: predicting the (k+1)'th number in a sequence. 

So here they are. 

If you are interested in contributing, issues are maintained in the timemachines package including suggestions for new notebooks here. See also the [contributors guide](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md). 

Typically these notebooks are the first step in a process that leads to creation and benchmarking of autonomous time-series forecasting methods.
